# Course Project for: Getting and Cleaning Data
### By Paul Lorett B. Amazona

1. Data/variables used in the run_analysis.R script
  * activity - contains the activity labels
  * clean_data - contains the processed main data (after cleaning)
  * features - contains the field names of the main data set
  * merged_label - contains the merged result of test and training labels
  * merged_subject - contains the merged result of test and training subjects
  * test_label - contains the loaded data from test/y_test.txt
  * test_set - contains the loaded data from test/X_test.txt
  * test_subject - contains the loaded data from test/subject_test.txt
  * tidy_data - contains the resulting data after getting the average measurements of the subject's activities
  * training_label - contains the loaded data from test/y_test.txt
  * training_set - contains the loaded data from train/X_train.txt
  * training_subject - contains the loaded data from subject_train.txt
  * activity_label - this contains the names of activities (i.e. "standing", "sitting",  "laying",   "walking",  "walkingDownstairs", "walkingUpstairs"  )
  * mean_sd_filter - refers to the list of measurements that pertains only mean or standard deviation
  
2. Variables used in the tidydata.txt output
  * subject: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its values are numeric (integer) and has a range from 1 to 30. 
  *	activity: This refers to the activity performed by the subject (i.e. "standing", "sitting",  "laying",   "walking",  "walkingDownstairs", "walkingUpstairs"  )
  
  The following variables contain the average values per subect and activity. All values are numeric (floating point numbers).
